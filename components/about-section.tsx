              Every year, millions visit Varanasi. They see the Ganga Aarti,
              visit the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, take a boat ride at dawn, and
              leave believing they have seen the city. They have not. Beneath the
              surface that tourists photograph lies a world of hidden shrines,
              forgotten rituals, secret lanes, and spiritual practices that have
              remained unchanged for thousands of years.

            <p className="leading-relaxed text-foreground/60">
              This project was born from a simple conviction: that the most
              profound experiences in Kashi are the ones no guidebook mentions.
              We seek to document the undocumented, to illuminate what has
              remained in shadow, and to invite conscious explorers to look
              beyond the obvious.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-foreground/60">
              We do not want to turn these hidden places into tourist
              attractions. We want to inspire a different kind of traveler: one
              who walks slowly, observes deeply, and understands that in Kashi,
              every stone has a story and every silence holds a secret.
